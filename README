"This project demonstrates secure JWT authentication using HTTP-only cookies â€” a production-ready approach that significantly enhances security compared to traditional methods like localStorage or sessionStorage. By leveraging HTTP-only cookies, tokens are inaccessible to JavaScript, reducing exposure to XSS attacks. This makes it one of the most recommended practices for handling authentication in modern web applications."

This project took care of the following tasks:

1. Custom User Model -> with Production-ready permissions
2. Http-only cookies for access token and refresh token
3. User Registration, email confirmation
4. User Login/
5. Refresh Token for access token regeneration
6. User Logout
7. Reset Password via email confirmation
8. Change Password while logged in
9. Custom Token-Cookie-based authentication using JWT
10. Cors headers configuration
11. Simple react frontend with axios for API testing.
12. And more...
